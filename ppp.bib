abstract = {Abstract Background Diarrheal diseases are the third leading cause of disease and death in children younger than 5 years of age in Africa and were responsible for an estimated 30 million cases of severe diarrhea (95{\%} credible interval, 27 million to 33 million) and 330,000 deaths (95{\%} credible interval, 270,000 to 380,000) in 2015. The development of targeted approaches to address this burden has been hampered by a paucity of comprehensive, fine-scale estimates of diarrhea-related disease and death among and within countries. Methods We produced annual estimates of the prevalence and incidence of diarrhea and diarrhea-related mortality with high geographic detail (5 km2) across Africa from 2000 through 2015. Estimates were created with the use of Bayesian geostatistical techniques and were calibrated to the results from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016.

abstract = {BACKGROUND Under-five mortality is declining in Ghana and many other countries. Very few studies have measured under-five mortality-and its social and environmental risk factors-at fine spatial resolutions, which is relevant for policy purposes. Our aim was to estimate under-five mortality and its social and environmental risk factors at the district level in Ghana. METHODS AND FINDINGS We used 10{\%} random samples of Ghana's 2000 and 2010 National Population and Housing Censuses. We applied indirect demographic methods and a Bayesian spatial model to the information on total number of children ever born and children surviving to estimate under-five mortality (probability of dying by 5 y of age, 5q0) for each of Ghana's 110 districts. We also used the census data to estimate the distributions of households or persons in each district in terms of fuel used for cooking, sanitation facility, drinking water source, and parental education. Median district 5q0 declined from 99 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2000 to 70 in 2010. The decline ranged from {\textless}5{\%} in some northern districts, where 5q0 had been higher in 2000, to {\textgreater}40{\%} in southern districts, where it had been lower in 2000, exacerbating existing inequalities. Primary education increased in men and women, and more households had access to improved water and sanitation and cleaner cooking fuels. Higher use of liquefied petroleum gas for cooking was associated with lower 5q0 in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS Under-five mortality has declined in all of Ghana's districts, but the cross-district inequality in mortality has increased. There is a need for additional data, including on healthcare, and additional environmental and socioeconomic measurements, to understand the reasons for the variations in mortality levels and trends.},

abstract = {Improved understanding of sub-national geographic variation and inequity in demographic and health indicators is increasingly recognized as central to meeting development goals. Data from DHS surveys are critical to monitoring progress in these indicators but are generally not used to support sub-national evaluation below the first-level administrative unit. This study explored the potential of geostatistical approaches for the production of interpolated surfaces from GPS cluster located survey data, and for the prediction of gridded surfaces at 5×5km resolution. The impact of DHS cluster displacement on these interpolated surfaces and the particular challenges of mapping in highly heterogeneous urban areas were also investigated. A flexible and robust geostatistical framework was proposed for generating and validating interpolated surfaces with georeferenced DHS survey data. The framework was tested by using four indicators from three different surveys. The accuracy of the interpolated surfaces varied between settings, and was driven by the spatial structure of each indicator and its relationship to available covariate data. The random displacement of DHS cluster geopositioning information reduced the precision of predicted maps, although the impact varied between settings and was generally modest. Over shorter distances, the greater degree of geographical heterogeneity that was associated with urban areas meant they were more sensitive to the impact of cluster displacement. High-resolution covariates and novel statistical approaches showed potential for improving mapping in these areas. This study demonstrated that, with appropriate modeling and validation, such data have broad utility for creating maps of a wide range of indicators that support improved geographically stratified decision-making. },

abstract = {Accurate estimates of the under-5 mortality rate (U5MR) in a developing world context are a key barometer of the health of a nation. This paper describes new models to analyze survey data on mortality in this context. We are interested in both spatial and temporal description, that is, wishing to estimate U5MR across regions and years, and to investigate the association between the U5MR and spatially-varying covariate surfaces. We illustrate the methodology by producing yearly estimates for subnational areas in Kenya over the period 1980 - 2014 using data from demographic health surveys (DHS). We use a binomial likelihood with fixed effects for the urban/rural stratification to account for the complex survey design. We carry out smoothing using Bayesian hierarchical models with continuous spatial and temporally discrete components. A key component of the model is an offset to adjust for bias due to the effects of HIV epidemics. Substantively, there has been a sharp decline in U5MR in the period 1980 - 2014, but large variability in estimated subnational rates remains. A priority for future research is understanding this variability. Temperature, precipitation and a measure of malaria infection prevalence were candidates for inclusion in the covariate model.},

abstract = {Structured additive regression models are perhaps the most commonly used class of models in statistical applications. It includes, among others, (generalized) linear models, (generalized) additive models, smoothing spline models, state space models, semiparametric regression, spatial and spatiotemporal models, log-Gaussian Cox processes and geostatistical and geoadditive models. We consider approximate Bayesian inference in a popular subset of structured additive regression models, latent Gaussian models, where the latent field is Gaussian, controlled by a few hyperparameters and with non-Gaussian response variables. The posterior marginals are not available in closed form owing to the non-Gaussian response variables. For such models, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods can be implemented, but they are not without problems, in terms of both convergence and computational time. In some practical applications, the extent of these problems is such that Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling is simply not an appropriate tool for routine analysis. We show that, by using an integrated nested Laplace approximation and its simplified version, we can directly compute very accurate approximations to the posterior marginals. The main benefit of these approximations is computational: where Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms need hours or days to run, our approximations provide more precise estimates in seconds or minutes. Another advantage with our approach is its generality, which makes it possible to perform Bayesian analysis in an automatic, streamlined way, and to compute model comparison criteria and various predictive measures so that models can be compared and the model under study can be challenged.},

{\textgreater} “Precision public health is already happening{\ldots}” 

The idea of precision public health has its roots in the precision medicine revolution, particularly in cancer treatment. By harnessing more effective tools—from big data to predictive analytics—oncologists are making more informed therapy decisions, applying specific agents to subtypes of tumors in ways that minimize side effects and maximize optimal clinical outcomes. This approach is starting to transform the way physicians think about treating other diseases, enabling different strategies, for different patients, at different times. Can we take the principles of precision medicine a step further, from individuals to populations?

Today, public health strategies involve epidemiologists examining geography, medical histories, biomarkers, and physical and demographic characteristics; and measuring exposures, behaviors, and susceptibility. General policies and programs are then developed. But a one-size-fits-all process does not always bring desired results. By more accurately detecting, identifying, and tracking unique traits in subpopulations, subgroups, or even communities, we can respond with greater precision.

Precision public health is already happening in a limited way, with big impact. Worldwide, around 17 million women are living with HIV. If an infected individual gets pregnant, she can pass the virus to her baby. Half those babies will die before their second birthday. Antiretroviral therapy almost guarantees that mothers will not pass on the virus. However, it has not been possible to test every pregnant woman everywhere for HIV, and then treat those who test positive. Instead, testing and treatment are focused on the areas of sub-Saharan Africa where enhanced data collection and analysis have revealed that HIV among women is most prevalent. This more exact approach to a public health problem has cut HIV transmission to babies by almost half in 5 years.

Although technological and scientific advances are changing the way some diseases and conditions are tracked and treated, there has been too little focus on how scientific tools used in high-resource areas can help people in low-resource areas. Take, for example, the lack of specificity around the 2.6 million neonatal deaths every year, most of which occur in the world's poorest countries. Much of what we know about them relies on “verbal autopsies” and model data. The Bill {\&} Melinda Gates Foundation is now working with partners on a program that takes tissue samples from the newborn to determine causes of death more definitively. The goal is to identify trends in a particular region, and then deliver specific interventions to help reduce infant mortality. Ultimately, I believe this approach could help save 1 million babies every year.

Imagine what more could be achieved. More children will survive and thrive if we know more about the causes of malnutrition in different populations with different diets and cultural practices. More women will avoid cervical cancer, the leading cause of cancer deaths in low-resource countries, if we know more about different risks in different populations. Fewer people will contract malaria if we know more about how it spreads differently among populations, and how the parasite and mosquito become resistant to remedies.

We have the tools to bring the right interventions, to the right people, in the right places to save lives. Now, we just need the will.

abstract = {BACKGROUND
During the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) era, many countries in Africa achieved marked reductions in under-5 and neonatal mortality. Yet the pace of progress toward these goals substantially varied at the national level, demonstrating an essential need for tracking even more local trends in child mortality. With the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015, which established ambitious targets for improving child survival by 2030, optimal intervention planning and targeting will require understanding of trends and rates of progress at a higher spatial resolution. In this study, we aimed to generate high-resolution estimates of under-5 and neonatal all-cause mortality across 46 countries in Africa. 

METHODS
We assembled 235 geographically resolved household survey and census data sources on child deaths to produce estimates of under-5 and neonatal mortality at a resolution of 5 × 5 km grid cells across 46 African countries for 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015. We used a Bayesian geostatistical analytical framework to generate these estimates, and implemented predictive validity tests. In addition to reporting 5 × 5 km estimates, we also aggregated results obtained from these estimates into three different levels—national, and subnational administrative levels 1 and 2—to provide the full range of geospatial resolution that local, national, and global decision makers might require. 

FINDINGS
Amid improving child survival in Africa, there was substantial heterogeneity in absolute levels of under-5 and neonatal mortality in 2015, as well as the annualised rates of decline achieved from 2000 to 2015. Subnational areas in countries such as Botswana, Rwanda, and Ethiopia recorded some of the largest decreases in child mortality rates since 2000, positioning them well to achieve SDG targets by 2030 or earlier. Yet these places were the exception for Africa, since many areas, particularly in central and western Africa, must reduce under-5 mortality rates by at least 8{\textperiodcentered}8{\%} per year, between 2015 and 2030, to achieve the SDG 3.2 target for under-5 mortality by 2030. 

INTERPRETATION
In the absence of unprecedented political commitment, financial support, and medical advances, the viability of SDG 3.2 achievement in Africa is precarious at best. By producing under-5 and neonatal mortality rates at multiple levels of geospatial resolution over time, this study provides key information for decision makers to target interventions at populations in the greatest need. In an era when precision public health increasingly has the potential to transform the design, implementation, and impact of health programmes, our 5 × 5 km estimates of child mortality in Africa provide a baseline against which local, national, and global stakeholders can map the pathways for ending preventable child deaths by 2030.

abstract = {Of particular importance to the study of large-scale phenomena in physical geography is the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP). While often viewed as only a problem in human geography (particularly demographic studies), the MAUP is an issue for all quantitative studies in geography of spatial phenomena (Openshaw and Taylor, 1979). Increasingly, remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are being used to assess the distribution of phenomena from a large scale. These phenomena are modelled using areal units that can take any shape or size resulting in complications with statistical analysis related to both the scale and method used to create the areal units. In this paper, we define the modifiable areal unit problem, present examples of when it is a problem in physical geography studies, and review some potential solutions to the problem.

abstract = {In this paper a Bayesian geostatistical model is presented for fusion of data obtained at point and areal resolutions. The model is fitted using the INLA and SPDE approaches. In the SPDE approach, a continuously indexed Gaussian random field is represented as a discretely indexed Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) by means of a finite basis function defined on a triangulation of the region of study. In order to allow the combination of point and areal data, a new projection matrix for mapping the GMRF from the observation locations to the triangulation nodes is proposed which takes into account the types of data to be combined. The performance of the model is examined and compared with the performance of the method RAMPS via simulation when it is fitted to (i) point, (ii) areal, and (iii) point and areal data to predict several simulated surfaces that can appear in real settings. The model is applied to predict the concentration of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), in Los Angeles and Ventura counties, United States, during 2011.},

@article{Burke2016,
abstract = {BACKGROUND Detailed spatial understanding of levels and trends in under-5 mortality is needed to improve the targeting of interventions to the areas of highest need, and to understand the sources of variation in mortality. To improve this understanding, we analysed local-level information on child mortality across sub-Saharan Africa between 1980-2010. METHODS We used data from 82 Demographic and Health Surveys in 28 sub-Saharan African countries, including the location and timing of 3{\textperiodcentered}24 million childbirths and 393 685 deaths, to develop high-resolution spatial maps of under-5 mortality in the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s. These estimates were at a resolution of 0{\textperiodcentered}1 degree latitude by 0{\textperiodcentered}1 degree longitude (roughly 10 km × 10 km). We then analysed this spatial information to distinguish within-country versus between-country sources of variation in mortality, to examine the extent to which declines in mortality have been accompanied by convergence in the distribution of mortality, and to study localised drivers of mortality differences, including temperature, malaria burden, and conflict. FINDINGS In our sample of sub-Saharan African countries from the 1980s to the 2000s, within-country differences in under-5 mortality accounted for 74-78{\%} of overall variation in under-5 mortality across space and over time. Mortality differed significantly across only 8-15{\%} of country borders, supporting the role of local, rather than national, factors in driving mortality patterns. We found that by the end of the study period, 23{\%} of the eligible children in the study countries continue to live in mortality hotspots-areas where, if current trends continue, the Sustainable Developent Goals mortality targets will not be met. In multivariate analysis, within-country mortality levels at each pixel were significantly related to local temperature, malaria burden, and recent history of conflict. INTERPRETATION Our findings suggest that sub-national determinants explain a greater portion of under-5 mortality than do country-level characteristics. Sub-national measures of child mortality could provide a more accurate, and potentially more actionable, portrayal of where and why children are still dying than can national statistics.

abstract = {The growing demand for spatially detailed data to advance the Sustainable Development Goals agenda of 'leaving no one behind' has resulted in a shift in focus from aggregate national and province-based metrics to small areas and high-resolution grids in the health and development arena. Vaccination coverage is customarily measured through aggregate-level statistics, which mask fine-scale heterogeneities and 'coldspots' of low coverage. This paper develops a methodology for high-resolution mapping of vaccination coverage using areal data in settings where point-referenced survey data are inaccessible. The proposed methodology is a binomial spatial regression model with a logit link and a combination of covariate data and random effects modelling two levels of spatial autocorrelation in the linear predictor. The principal aspect of the model is the melding of the misaligned areal data and the prediction grid points using the regression component and each of the conditional autoregressive and the Gaussian spatial process random effects. The Bayesian model is fitted using the INLA-SPDE approach. We demonstrate the predictive ability of the model using simulated data sets. The results obtained indicate a good predictive performance by the model, with correlations of between 0.66 and 0.98 obtained at the grid level between true and predicted values. The methodology is applied to predicting the coverage of measles and diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccinations at 5x5 km in Afghanistan and Pakistan using subnational Demographic and Health Surveys data. The predicted maps are used to highlight vaccination coldspots and assess progress towards coverage targets to facilitate the implementation of more geographically precise interventions. The proposed methodology can be readily applied to wider disaggregation problems in related contexts, including mapping other health and development indicators.},

@article{Wang2016,
abstract = {BACKGROUND In the past two decades, the under-5 mortality rate in China has fallen substantially, but progress with regards to the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 4 at the subnational level has not been quantified. We aimed to estimate under-5 mortality rates in mainland China for the years 1970 to 2012. METHODS We estimated the under-5 mortality rate for 31 provinces in mainland China between 1970 and 2013 with data from censuses, surveys, surveillance sites, and disease surveillance points. We estimated under-5 mortality rates for 2851 counties in China from 1996 to 2012 with the reported child mortality numbers from the Annual Report System on Maternal and Child Health. We used a small area mortality estimation model, spatiotemporal smoothing, and Gaussian process regression to synthesise data and generate consistent provincial and county-level estimates. We compared progress at the county level with what was expected on the basis of income and educational attainment using an econometric model. We computed Gini coefficients to study the inequality of under-5 mortality rates across counties. FINDINGS In 2012, the lowest provincial level under-5 mortality rate in China was about five per 1000 livebirths, lower than in Canada, New Zealand, and the USA. The highest provincial level under-5 mortality rate in China was higher than that of Bangladesh. 29 provinces achieved a decrease in under-5 mortality rates twice as fast as the MDG 4 target rate; only two provinces will not achieve MDG 4 by 2015. Although some counties in China have under-5 mortality rates similar to those in the most developed nations in 2012, some have similar rates to those recorded in Burkina Faso and Cameroon. Despite wide differences, the inter-county Gini coefficient has been decreasing. Improvement in maternal education and the economic boom have contributed to the fall in child mortality; more than 60{\%} of the counties in China had rates of decline in under-5 mortality rates significantly faster than expected. Fast reduction in under-5 mortality rates have been recorded not only in the Han population, the dominant ethnic majority in China, but also in the minority populations. All top ten minority groups in terms of population sizes have experienced annual reductions in under-5 mortality rates faster than the MDG 4 target at 4.4{\%}. INTERPRETATION The reduction of under-5 mortality rates in China at the country, provincial, and county level is an extraordinary success story. Reductions of under-5 mortality rates faster than 8.8{\%} (twice MDG 4 pace) are possible. Extremely rapid declines seem to be related to public policy in addition to socioeconomic progress. Lessons from successful counties should prove valuable for China to intensify efforts for those with unacceptably high under-5 mortality rates.

abstract = {Improved understanding of geographic variation and inequity in health status, wealth, and access to resources within countries is central to meeting sustainable development goals. The Demographic Health Survey (DHS) Program's modeled surface contributes to the greater need of the development community for small area estimations of health and demographics. The DHS Program is making publicly available a standard set of spatially modeled surfaces for each population-based survey with a select list of indicators relevant for health, demographic, and development decision-making. The modeled surfaces are created with geo-coded cluster information for current and future population-based DHS surveys and a selection of earlier surveys. The maps are publicly available for download on The DHS Program Spatial Data Repository (http://spatialdata.dhsprogram.com/). This guidance document will provide users with a deeper understanding of The DHS Program modeled surfaces and their potential use in decision-making. The DHS Program has adopted the Model-Based Geostatistics (MBG) approach to creating the modeled surfaces. This is a method for creating statistically rigorous interpolated surfaces that generate new data values for unsampled areas from sampled data points. Such an expansive number of modeled surfaces for a diverse group of health and demographic indicators has never been offered in the past and, as such, the potential uses are still nascent. Many users will find new, innovative ways to use the modeled surfaces that are not discussed or fully analyzed in this document. },
